DURING the past several decades there has been a growing interest in location theory in America. Building on the pioneering works of Thtinen, Weber, Lbsch, Palander, and others, a number of economists and geographers have extended the analysis to apply to a wide range of problems and have attempted to synthesize location theory with other fields of economics. However, very little work has been done in using the principles of location to analyze the historical growth of regions in America. While economists concerned with location theory sometimes point out the implications of their analysis for the growth of regions, they have not followed up these discrete observations with any systematic analysis. A fundamental difficulty has been that the theory of regional economic growth' has little relevance for the development of regions in America. Not only does the sequence of stages outlined by the theory bear little resemblance to American development but its policy implications are also fundamentally misleading.
This paper will attempt to demonstrate the inadequacies of the existing theory of regional economic growth and will advance a number of propositions that may lead to a more useful theory, both for analyzing the historical development of the American economy and for understanding the contemporary problems associated with regional economic growth.
The analytical propositions advanced in this paper, though explicitly oriented to America's development, would apply equally well to other areas that meet the following conditions: (1) regions that have grown up within a framework of capitalist institutions and have therefore responded to profit maximizing opportunities, in which factors of production have been relatively mobile,6 and (2) regions that have grown up without the strictures imposed by population pressure.

Both location theory and the theory of regional economic growth have described a typical sequence of stages through which regions move in the course of their development. E. M. Hoover and Joseph Fisher, in a recent essay entitled "Research in Regional Economic Growth," point out that "there is now a fairly well accepted body of theory regarding the normal sequence of development stages in a region."' This sequence may be outlined as follows:
1. The first stage in the economic history of most regions is one of a selfsufficient subsistence economy in which there is little investment or trade. The basic agricultural stratum of population is simply located according to the distribution of natural resources.
2. With improvements in transport, the region develops some trade and local specialization. "A second stratum of population comes into being, carrying on simple village industries for the farmers. Since the materials, the market, and the labor are all furnished originally by the agricultural populations, the new 'industrial superstructure' is located with ref erence to that 'basic stratum.'
3. With the increase of interregional trade, a region tends to move through a succession of agricultural crops from extensive grazing to cereal production to fruitgrowing, dairy farming, and truck gardening.
4. With increased population and diminishing returns in agriculture and other extractive industries, a region is forced to industrialize. "Industrialization means the introduction of socalled secondary industries (mining and manufacturing) on a considerable scale." Typically the early stages of industrialization are based on the products of agriculture and forestry and include such activities as the processing of food, the manufacture of wood products, and the preparation of textile fibers. If industrialization is to continue, mineral and energy resources become critical.
As a second stage of industrialization, then, we see [in the regions possessing economically usable mineral resources] such industries as the smelting, refining, and processing of metals; oil refining; chemical industries based mainly on coal, petroleum, potash, salt, and other minerals; and glass and ceramics industries. Where cheap hydroelectric power is available, industries requiring large amounts of cheap power (nonferrous metals refining, ferroalloys, and special steels, artificial abrasives, etc.) are possible, as in Norway, Switzerland, the Tennessee Valley, and the Columbia River Valley.
5. A final stage of regional growth is reached when a region specializes in tertiary industries producing for export. Such a region exports to less advanced regions capital, skilled personnel, and special services.
The role of transport costs has been critical in the advancement through these successive stages of growth. Isard summarizes this effect as follows: "Historically we find that reduced transport rates have tended (1) to transform a scattered, ubiquitous pattern of production into an increasingly concentrated one, and (2) to effect progressive differentiation and selection between sites with superior and inferior resources and trade routes."
III
When this sequence of stages is placed against the economic history of regions in America, two basic objections arise. (1) These stages bear little resemblance to the actual development of regions. Moreover, they fail to provide any insights into the causes of growth and change. A theory of regional economic growth should clearly focus on the critical factors that implement or impede development. (2) Furthermore, if we want a normative model of how regions' should grow, in order to analyze the causes of arrested development or relative decay, then this sequence of stages is of little use and is actually misleading in the emphasis it places on the need for (and difficulties of) industrialization.
The problems of industrialization will be explored later in this paper when the causes of regional growth are examined. Here we are concerned with the first objection: the lack of correspondence between the stages of the theory of regional economic growth and the economic history of regions in America. A major discrepancy is immediately evident; namely, that America was exploited in large part as a capitalist venture. Settlement in new regions and their subsequent growth were shaped by the search for and exploitation of goods in demand on world markets. The result was a kind of development very different from that implied by the theory of regional development in which regions gradually extended the market from a subsistence economy. From the early jointstock companies on through the whole westward expansion, a basic objective was to exploit the land and its resources in order to produce goods that could be marketed "abroad" and would bring in a money income. This is in marked contrast to the experience of Europe (which appears to be the model for the early stages of the theory of regional economic growth), where a marketoriented economy emerged only gradually from the predominantly local economies of the manorial system. If a subsistence economy existed in a new region in America, it was solely because of a lack of means of transport, a condition that was swiftly remedied by the concerted efforts of the settlers. This is not to deny that many homesteaders maintained a subsistence existence but only to affirm that such settlement was not significant in shaping the economic development of the region, any more than the modern subsistence farmer of the backcountry is shaping the development of contemporary agriculture.
This point may be illustrated briefly from the economic history of the Pacific Northwest. Not only has this region never experienced a subsistence economy, but its markets from the very beginning have often been thousands of miles distant. Even before general settlement, the region was exploited for its furs by the Hudson Bay Company. With the decline of the fur trade and the coming of settlers, wheat, flour, and lumber were quickly developed as exportable commodities. They first found markets in California in the 1840's. With the gold rush the demand for both wheat and lumber expanded tremendously, and the region experienced rapid growth based on these two commodities. In 1868 the first wheat shipment went from Portland to Liverpool, and by the late 1870's Pacific Northwest soft wheat had become an important part of the world wheat trade; a fleet of ships sailed from the region around Cape Horn every year. In 1857 the first shipment of flour was made to Japan, and thereafter Pacific Northwest flour found markets in Australia, Hawaii, the Orient, Europe, British Columbia, and California. In each decade after 1850 an increasing percentage of the crop was exported either as wheat or in the form of flour. Before the end of the nineteenth century over half the crop was being exported from the region.
The history of the lumber industry reflects a similar preoccupation with markets foreign to the region. The first lumber shipment went to California in 1847, and during the gold rush lumber exports from the Pacific Northwest expanded rapidly. The rate of growth of the lumber industry was directly related to the growth of the markets reached by water (primarily California, British Columbia, and some foreign markets). In 1894 James J. Hill established a 40 cent per hundredweight freight rate on lumber to Minneapolis on his railroads, and the industry began to compete with the southern pine region for markets in the Middle West. With this rapid growth of markets the industry expanded many fold. In the first five years of the twentieth century output more than doubled, and thereafter in each successive decade Pacific Northwest fir increased its share of the national market at the expense of southern pine. The rate of growth of the region has been directly related to these basic exports. Between 1860 and 1920 lumber and flourmilling accounted for between 40 and 60 per cent of the value of the region's manufacturing output. Almost all the rest of secondary industry (as well as tertiary industry) was passive in the sense that it served local consumer needs. its growth therefore reflected the changing fortunes of the region's exportable commodities. Wheat played a similarly critical role in the development of the region, although by the end of the nineteenth century the agricultural export base had broadened to include a number of other commodities.
This brief account of the development of the Pacific Northwest bears no resemblance to the theory of regional economic growth. There was no gradual evolution out of a subsistence economy. Instead the whole development of the region from the beginning was dependent on its success in producing exportable commodities. Nor was the Pacific Northwest's history exceptional. Furs and the products of mining were typically the early exportable commodities of western America. Colonial America exported such products as tobacco, rice, indigo, naval stores, ships, and fish. Even the wellworn historical generalization of location theorists that reduced transport rates will transform a scattered, ubiquitous pattern of production into an increasingly concentrated one is not true of America. Many new regions in America developed from the beginning around one or two exportable commodities and only widened their export base after transport costs had been reduced. In short, both this generalization of location theorists and the early stages in the theory of regional economic growth appear to be taken uncritically from European experience rather than derived from the economic history of this country.
A basic starting point for reshaping our views on regional economic growth might well be the insights of the late Harold Innis in his studies of the growth of the Canadian economy.2' Innis' early research had convinced him of the crucial importance of the export staple in shaping new economies. His subsequent studies of the growth of these staple exports were always directed toward attempting to understand "how the Canadian economy had been generated and how it had been shaped as a working economy. An analysis of the export staples of the Canadian economy became the basis for understanding the character of that country's economic development. Moreover, it provided real insights into the political and social institutions of the country.
The term "staple" refers to the chief commodity produced by a region. It is customarily thought of as describing products of extractive industry. Since my concept of the export commodities of a region may include products of secondary or tertiary industry as well, I shall use the term "exportable commodities" (or services) to denote the individual items and the export base to denote collectively the exportable commodities (or services) of a region. In young regions, typically dependent on extractive industry, my exportable commodities and Innis' export staples are synonymous.
Settlers in new regions typically experimented with a number of different crops before discovering one that was economicallyf easible. The success of an industry in producing an exportable commodity can be understood in terms of the principles of location theory. The development of an exportable commodity reflected a comparative advantage in relative costs of production, including transfer costs. Distributive transfer costs have served to limit the extent of the export market.
From the viewpoint of the region, the demand for the exportable commodity was an exogenous factor, but both processing and transfer costs were not. Historically new regions bent every effort to reduce these costs in their concerted drive to promote their economic wellbeing. The ceaseless efforts of new regions to get federally subsidized internal improvements, state aid for canal construction, federal and state aid for railroads, and river and harbor improvements were a part of the continuous effort of each region to reduce transfer costs to better the competitive position of its exports.
As regions grew up around the export base, external economies developed which improved the competitive cost position of the exportable commodities. The development of specialized marketing organization, improved credit and transport facilities, a trained labor force, and complementary industries was oriented to the export base.
The concerted effort to improve the technology of production has been equally important. Agricultural experiment stations, state universities, and other local research groups become service adjuncts to export industries and conduct research in technological improvements in agriculture, mining, or whatever manufacturing comprises the region's export base.
The purpose of this concerted effort is better to enable the region to compete with other regions or foreign countries for markets. In new regions highly dependent on extractive industry, these external economies and technological developments tend to more than counteract diminishing returns in the staple product. As a result, these efforts tend to reinforce a region's dependence on its existing staples rather than promote changes in the export base. This conservative bias is further reinforced by the role of capital. Capital is typically imported into new regions in the development of the export staple industries. Indeed, until a region develops sufficient income to provide a substantial share of its own investment capital, it must rely upon outside sources. External suppliers of capital tend to invest primarily in existing export industry rather than in new, untried enterprises.
IV
The following section will deal with the way in which regions grow; first, however, we must explore the significance of the export base in shaping the whole character of a region's economy.
At the outset, export industries must l)e clearly distinguished from "residentiary industries." The term "residentiary" is used to designate industry for the local market which develops where the consuming population resides. In order to determine the market area of each industry more precisely than can be done by a priori classification, the "location quotient" developed by Hildebrand and Mace is employed. The location quotient measures the concentration of employment in a given industry in one area (the "subject economy," which for our purposes is the region) with another area (the "benchmark economy," which for our purposes is the nation).
Formally the location quotient is the numerical equivalent of a fraction whose numerator is employment in a given industry in the subject economy relative to total employment in the subject economy and whose denominator is employment in the given industry in the benchmark economy relative to total employment in the benchmark economy. A priori a location of 1.00 means no greater relative specialization in the subject economy than in the benchmark economy, for the particular industry. In each industry values significantly below 1.00 indicate much greater relative specialization in the benchmark economy; or if well over 1.00 much greater relative specialization in the subject economy. Thus industries producing for export will show values significantly above 1.00.
Wre are now in a better position to examine the role of the export base in shaping the economy of the region.
Clearly the export base plays a vital role in determining the level of absolute and per capita income of a region. While the return to factors of production in the export industries indicates the direct importance of these industries for the wellbeing of the region, it is the indirect effect that is most important. Since residentiary industry depends entirely on demand within the region, it has historically been dependent on the fate of the export base. Vining's analysis indicates that employment in residentiary industry tends to bear a direct relationship to employment in export industries. The median figure for employment in residentiary industry in individual states was approximately 55 per cent of the total employment.
The export staple plays an equally vital role in the cyclical sensitivity of the region; it acts as the "carrier" in diffusing changes in the level of income from other regions to the subject region. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the region to fluctuations depends on the income elasticities of the export staples. Clearly regions that specialize in a few products with high income elasticities will have more violent fluctuations in income than more diversified regions.
When we turn to the role of exports in shaping the pattern of urbanization and nodal centers, we are on ground that has been more thoroughly explored by location theorists and geographers. Again, however, the pioneering work has been done by German location theorists who have extended the implications of each stage of economic growth to embrace the logical pattern of urbanization that would ensue. Since these stages do not fit the American development, the pattern of American urbanization likewise differs in many respects from the German models. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to explore the whole question of urbanization and the export base. We may note in passing the observations of August L6sch that in such areas as Iowa, with a rather even distribution of production of agricultural staples, the distances between towns increase with their size. In contrast, cities in the English coal districts are the same distance from each other irrespective of size.
While discussion of the spatial distribution of urban areas would take us too far afield, the role of the export base in shaping the growth of nodal centers deserves some attention. Nodes grow up because of special locational advantages that lower the transfer and processing costs of exportable commodities. Nodal centers become trading centers through which exports leave the region and imports enter for distribution throughout the area. Here special facilities develop to implement the production and distribution of the staples. Subsidiary industries to service the export industry, as well as specialized banking, brokerage, wholesaling, and other business services, concentrate in these centers and act to improve the cost position of the export.
The character of the labor force will be fundamentally influenced by the export industries. The types of skills required, the seasonality and stability of employment, and the conditions of work will shape the social attitudes of the working force.
As already noted, the political attitudes of the region will be largely directed toward improving the position of its export base. The extent of such activity is too well known historically and too obvious in the contemporary American political scene to require extended discussion.
V
Previous sections of this paper have examined the significance of the export base for a region's economy. I have tried to indicate the primary role that such exports have played historically, but I have not yet touched on the critical question of the causes of the growth of a region. It is evident that this growth is closely tied to the success of its exports and may take place either as a result of the improved position of existing exports relative to competing areas or as a result of the development of new exports. However, a major question that must first be examined is whether a region must industrialize if it is to continue to grow. Such a necessity has been a major tenet of the theory of regional economic growth. Moreover, industrialization has been regarded as a difficult stage to achieve, so that it is the source of problems of arrested regional development. Hoover and Fisher stress three factors that make this transition difficult: (1) the need for greatly improved transportation facilities, which call for largescale capital investments; (2) the need for intensification of the geographic division of labor; and (3) the fact that industrial technology is novel to an agriculturalr egion. If these statements are correct, then the implications for our analysis are clear. At some point regions must shift from an extractive to an industrial export base, and this shift will be fraught with difficulties. However, the contention that regions must industrialize in order to continue to grow, as well as the contention that the development of secondary and tertiary industry is somehow difficult to achieve, are both based on some fundamental misconceptions.
The importance of industrializing is based upon the notion that, with increased population and diminishing returns in extractive industry, the shift to manufacturing is the only way to maintain sustained growth (measured in terms of increasing per capita income). This argument has been buttressed by evidence such as that gathered by Dr. Louis Bean correlating per capita income with percentage of the labor force engaged in primary, secondary, and tertiary occupations by states for 1939. Bean's figures purport to demonstrate that increased industrialization leads to higher per capita income, and he goes so far as to say that "a 10point [per cent] increase in industrial progress in the east and south ... apparently tends to add $100 to $150 (1939 prices) per capita and in the western states substantially more." In fact, Bean's statistics do not prove this, and the policy implications of such generalizations may be misleading and dangerous.
We may note first of 'all that his correlation is not very impressive. There were eleven states in which the percentage of the labor force in primary occupations was above the national average whose per capita income either exceeded the national average or was close enough to the average so that annual variations could well place it on one side or the other. Indeed, had the correlation been made for postwar years, it would have been substantially different. Furthermore, moneyincome data significantly understate the real income of the farmer, because of the great variety of goods and services produced on the farm that require cash payment in the city.
However, the real source of error has resulted from a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the economy. A state whose export base consists mostly of agricultural products may have a low percentage of its labor force in primary activity and a high percentage in tertiary occupations and yet be basically dependent upon agriculture for the high per capita income it enjoys. It is the agricultural export staples that provide the high income that enables the state to support a substantial level of services. In such a case both the secondary and the tertiary activities are "residentiary" and can survive only because of the success of the basic agricultural export staples. In short, a percentage shift in such a state from primary to secondary and tertiary employment does not necessarily reflect a shift away from dependence on agriculture to dependence on manufacturing and services. Instead, it may reflect the simple fact that farmers are receiving high incomes for their staple crops and, therefore buy more goods and services from residentiary industry.
This brings us to the related question of the difficulty of industrialization. The implication of the preceding paragraph is that a substantial amount of secondary industry of the residentiary variety wills develop automatically as a result of high incomes received from the exportable commodities. Nor is this the only kind of manufacturing that can be expected to develop. We may distinguish four different kinds of manufacturing that will develop.
1. Materialsorientedin dustriesw hich, because of marked transfer advantages of the manufactured product over the raw material, locate at the source of the latter. Among the industries in this category are sugarbeet refining, flourmilling, and lumbering. Such industries may develop further stages of vertical integration until transfer cost advantages become equalized. Such industry is typically part of the export base.
2. Service industries to the export industry. Foundries and establishments that make machine tools, specialized agricultural implements, and logging and lumbering equipment are illustrations.
3. Residentiary industry producing for local consumption.
4. Footloose industries, where transfer costs are not of significant importance in location. A great many such industries develop purely by chance in some location.
While footloose industries have typically developed by chance, the other three types of secondary activity develop naturally because of locational advantages in a society responsive to profitmaximizing stimuli. There is nothing difficult about the development of such industries. The difficulties arise when promoters seek to develop in a region industries which simply are unsuited for the area and which can therefore only be maintained under hothouse conditions.
The argument may be advanced that the kinds of industry described above do not constitute industrialization. How much and what kind of secondary industry must a region possess to be termed "industrialized"? By 1950 census classification, the state of Oregon had almost 24 per cent of its labor force in manufacturing, which was only slightly under the United States average (25.9 per cent) and exceeded the United States average in durable goods (16.7 per cent as compared with the national average of 13.8 per cent). It was well ahead of the neighboring states of Washington and California, despite the fact that these two states had a variety of manufacturing industries, in contrast to Oregon's specialized dependence on the Douglas fir lumber industry. Is such a state industrialized?I mplicit in the concept appears to be the notion that industrialization is somehow tied up with steel and the capital goods industries. However, historically, the locational pull of coal and iron ore has shaped the development of the steelproducing centers, which in turn have attracted and concentratedh eavy industry. While locational influences in the steel industry have been changing significantly in the last halfcentury with the growing importance of scrap and the changing composition of inputs, nevertheless, the possible areas for the development of efficient largescale steel production5 and, therefore, capital goods industry are severely circumscribed. Amore useful concept of industrialization for our purposes is a region whose export base consists primarily of finished consumers' goods and/or finished manufactured producers' goods.
We may summarize the argument up to this point as follows: (1) There is no reason why all regions must industrialize in order to continue to grow. (2) A great deal of secondary (and tertiary) industry will develop automatically either because of locational advantages of materialsoriented industry or as a passive reflection of growing income in the region resulting from the success of its exportable commodities. (3) The concept of industrialization is an ambiguous one that needs further clarification if it is to be useful.
Since the growth of a region is tied to the success of its export base, we must examine in more detail the reasons for the growth, decline, and change in the export base. Clearly, the decline of one exportable commodity must be accompanied by the growth of others, or a region will be left "stranded." Among the major reasons for the decline of an existing exportable commodity have been changes in demand outside the region, exhaustion of a natural resource, increasing costs of land or labor relative to those of a competing region, and technological changes that changed the relative composition of inputs. A historically important reason for the growth of new exports has been major developments in transport (in contrast with mere costreducing improvements in transport, which may reinforce dependence on existing exports). Such developments have often enabled a region to compete with other regions in the production of goods that were previously economically unfeasible because of the high transfer costs. Growth in income and demand in other regions and technological developments65h ave also been important. The role of the state and federal government in creating social overhead benefits has created new exports in many regions,16 and the significance of war in promoting industries that may either continue or leave a residue of capital investment for peacetime use has also been important.
A region may expand as a result of increased demand for its existing exportable commodities, whether due to an increase in the income of the market area or to a change in taste. An improvement in the processing or transfercost position of the region's staples visavis competing regions will likewise promote growth.
Historically, in a young region, the creation of a new export or the expansion of an existing export has resulted in the influx of capital investment both in the export industry and in all the kinds of passive and supporting economic activity described above. Meier has described this process for the Canadian economy in the first decade of the twentieth century, when increased world demand for wheat not only led to an expansion of warehousing, transport, public utilities, and (constructionin the PrairieP rovinces,but also, by increasing income, augmented demand for secondary products and thereby induced investment in a host of other industries. As a result the growth of a region will, in all likelihood, be uneven, coming in spurts of increased investment rather than proceeding at an even pace.
Increased capital investment in the export industry will go toward achieving optimum size of the enterprise, increased mechanization of the processes, and further development of the specialized services to the export. The source of capital will play an important part in the region's growth. Typically, the capital in young regions comes from outside. Profits (and some other nonwage income) flow out of the region. To the extent that the export base is profitable, a part of this income will be reinvested in the expansion of this base.
With the growth of population and income, indigenous savings will increase. Both indigenous savings and the reinvested capital can pour back into the export industries only up to a point, and then the accumulated capital will tend to overflow into other activity. As described above, some will go into residentiary industry and industries subsidiary to the export; but it is also very likely that some will go into locationally "footloose" industries, which may start out to serve only the region, but which can expand into export industries.
At this point a region is no longer young. The social overhead benefits that have been created through political pressure or as a part of the pattern of urban development and the development of a trained labor force and indigenous capital make it far easier to develop new exports. Whether such industries were originally residentiary and, by gradually overcoming transfercost disadvantages, became export industries, or were originally footloose industries not significantly affected by transfer costs, the result is to broaden the export base. As such a region matures, the staple base will become less distinguishable, since its production will be so varied. We may expect, therefore, that the differences between regions will become less marked, that secondary industry will tend to be more equalized, and indeed in economic terms that regionalism will tend to disappear.
VI
The purpose of this paper has been to reexamine location theory and the theory of regional economic growth in the light of the historical development of regions in America and to advance some propositions that may lead to a new theory of regional economic growth.
It has been argued that the stages outlined in the theory of regional economic growth bear little relationship to the character of American development and more specifically do not focus on the crucial elements that will enable us to understand that growth. Furthermore, the traditional theory has policy implications that may be fundamentally in error.
The first stage of subsistence has been relatively unimportant, and, to the extent that it existed at all, it was because means of transport were lacking rather than because of a nonmarket orientation. In Europe a subsistence or a village economy with local markets was built into the social and economic structure for centuries. In America subsistence was only a frontier condition to be overcome as rapidly as means of transport could be built.
The second stage of the theory is based on a gradual widening of the market area with improved transport and the development of a second stratum to service the basic agricultural stratum. Far from moving through such a gradual progression American regions, as soon as any transport permitted, developed goods for export often to markets thousands of miles away. The early town centers were located not only so as to service the agricultural stratum but so as to implement the export of the region's staples. The prosperity of the region depended on its success in competing with other areas producing the same staple exports. Therefore, the region's economic and political efforts were oriented toward the reduction of processing and transfer costs. The struggle for internal improvements by the West, the agrarian pressure for inflation and cheaper credit, and the campaign for free coinage of silver were fundamentally economic movements. Their objectives included increasing the supply of capital, eliminating real or fancied transport discrimination, reducing interest rates, and improving the market for silver, however much they may also have been concerned with social justice.
The third stage of regional growth has been described as the gradual shift from extensive to intensive farming. While it is true that rising land values promoted such a shift, there were many other reasons for a shift in the staple base. New means of transport, changing demand, new technological developments, changing cost relationships vis1vis competing regions, government subsidization of social overhead benefits, and war have all been important.
The shift from an agricultural to an industrial base has been looked upon as the difficult, but indispensable, step for sustained economic growth. It is a major argument of this paper that such a step may be neither necessary nor desirable and that the evidence customarily advanced to support this argument proves nothing of the sort. There is nothing to prevent population and per capita income from growing in a region whose export base is agricultural. Moreover, there is nothing difficult about developing secondary and tertiary industry in such a region. Indeed, it will develop automatically, often to such an extent that analysis of the region in terms of distribution of employment will lead to the conclusion that it is an industrial region.
The final stage has typically been conceived to be the mature regional economy exporting capital, skills, and specialized services to lesswelldeveloped regions. While this may be true for some regions, it is unlikely to be a final stage for all. Indeed, one would presume that some sort of balanced relationship would emerge among regions as transfer costs become less significant and income differentials tend to be ironed out by longrun factor mobility.
The major propositions that emerge from this paper are:
1. For economists' purposes the concept of a region should be redefined to point out that the unifying cohesion to a region, over and beyond geographic similarities, is its development around a common export base. It is this that makes it economically unified and ties the fortunes of the area together. This tends to result in the interdependent development within the region of external economies and unified political efforts for government assistance or political reform. The geographer has emphasized the distributive functions of the nodal centers of a region, but the role of the nodal center in providing external economies for the export industries has been equally important.
2. The success of the export base has been the determining factor in the rate of growth of regions. Therefore, in order to understand this growth, we must examine the locational factors that have enabled the staples to develop.
3. The importance of the export base is a result of its primary role in determining the level of absolute and per capita income in a region, and therefore in determining the amount of residentiary secondary and tertiary activity that will develop. The export base has also significantly influenced the character of subsidiary industry, the distribution of population and pattern of urbanization, the character of the labor force, the social and political attitudes of the region, and its sensitivity to fluctuations of income and employment.
4. In a young region dependence on staples is reinforced by the concerted efforts of the region's residents to reduce processing and transfer costs through technological research, and state and federal government subsidization of social overhead benefits, as well as the tendency for outside suppliers of capital to reinvest in the existing staple base.
5. Some regions, because of locational advantages, have developed an export base of manufactured products, but this is not a necessary stage for the sustained growth of all regions. A great deal of secondary and tertiary industry will result from the success of the export base. This residentiary industry will, in all likelihood, provide for widening the export base as a region develops.
6. The growth of regions has tended to be uneven. A given increase in demand for the region's exports (or a significant reduction in processing or transfer costs) has resulted in a multiple effect on the region, inducing increased investment not only in the export industry but in all other kinds of economic activity as well.
7. As a region's income grows, indigenous savings will tend to spill over into new kinds of activities. At first, these activities satisfy local demand, but ultimately some of them will become export industries. This movement is reinforced by the tendency for transfer costs to become less significant. As a result, the export bases of regions tend to become more diversified, and they tend to lose their identity as regions. Ultimately, we may expect with longrun factor mobility more equalization of per capita income and a wider dispersion of production.
